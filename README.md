# advisor_app

The project was copied from [here](https://github.com/uva-cs3240-s23/project-b-17), and has been done so so I can continue to modify the files if needed, since the old repo in non-editable.

This was a project done in CS 3240 (Advanced Software Development Techniques) at the University of Virginia. It is an app written with the Django framework that allows advisors to approves schedules sent to them by students.
