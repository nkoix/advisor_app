# advisor_app

The project was copied from the original project[ ](https://github.com/uva-cs3240-s23/project-b-17)so I can continue to modify the files if needed, since the old repo is non-editable.

This was a project done in CS 3240 (Advanced Software Development Techniques) at the University of Virginia. It is an app written with the Django framework (Python) that allows advisors to approves schedules sent to them by students.

# Run Site on Local Server

While the original project was hosted on Heroku, it is not anymore. However, it is still possible to view this site via a local host. To run this app on a local server, first download all the files in this project folder.

Next, make sure you have a python interpreter on your local terminal (`pip3` is my personal favorite), and install bootstrap5 with `pip install django-bootstrap-v5`.

Then, while in the *outer* `advisor_app` folder, run `python manage.py runserver`, and copy the link it gives you, and open in any browser.
